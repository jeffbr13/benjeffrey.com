Employment
----------

### Office Assistant, [Anarkik3D](http://www.anarkik3d.co.uk/) (June 2011)

One week of work experience, which included
playing with the company's 3D drafting software, writing
a small Python application to interface with social networks,
neatening up webpages, brewing the tea, and other essential
office-work.


### Junior Javascript Developer, [Accendo Design](http://www.accendodesign.com/) (July → August 2011)

Three weeks of work experience, given the Rhino book to learn Javascript
on the job, and wrote some webform validation code for a real-estate management
startup. First tastes of many strange and exotic teas.


### Waiter, [Fratello's Restaurant Scotch Corner](http://www.fratellosscotchcorner.co.uk/) (Summer 2012)

Bussing tables, manning the bar, serving banquets. Not much time for tea.

Variety of teas provided, excellent coffee from the company barista machine!


### Telephone Interviewer, [Ipsos Mori Scotland](http://www.ipsos-mori.com/offices/scotland.aspx) (December 2012 → January 2013)

Collecting survey data over the telephone, from participant feedback on
government programs to the monthly political thermometer. Brought my own
cuppas in a thermos.


### Data Acquisition Intern, [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net) (Summer 2013)

I worked with a team of other interns, maintaining and growing Skyscanner's
large collection of international airline scrapers, written in Python.
Duties included maintaining and updating database records, as well as
interfacing with airline counterparts in resolving issues with APIs or
webscrapers.


### Co-founder, [Pitchpatch/ptchd](http://www.ptchd.com) (Summer 2013)

My co-founder [Caroline Nguyen](http://about.me/caroline.nguyen) and I managed to win one of
[Jisc](http://jisc.ac.uk/)'s £5,000 [Summer of Student Innovation](http://jisc.ac.uk/student-innovation) grants,
giving us the runway needed to pursue a project we'd both been working on since a Startup Weekend in 2012.

We successfully built and demonstrated a prototype "skills-marketplace" for university campuses,
and were offered a further £10,000 of funding from Jisc.

Unfortunately the project was taking a toll on my other work, and so I parted ways with my co-founder in order to focus
on school and my part-time work at Skyscanner.


### Data Acquisition Software Engineer, [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net) (October 2013 → present)

I've continued my work at Skyscanner on a part-time basis since October.

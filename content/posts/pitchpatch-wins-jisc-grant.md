I just want to say thanks to everyone who voted for us in Jisc's
["Summer of Student Innovation"][sosi] competition! Caroline and myself
*literally* couldn't have done it without you.

By the end of July
the University of Edinburgh will receive (and begin distributing) the
Elevator Fund grant money to us.
However, we're already starting work on [Pitchpatch][] in
earnest, and thinking up ways to ~~blow all this spending money~~ make the
best use of
these newly-acquired resources!

We're [one of 21 winners][winners] from a total of 36 submitted ideas (so
the field wasn't huge) but they were of a pretty high standard overall,
with [one][goncode] or [two][wikinets] really piquing my attention.
It was a pretty strong result for a competition aiming to stimulating innovation
inside of universities, and I'm really looking forward to the results
of all the other projects.

As one of the prize's conditions we have to post our process frequently,
so do follow our Pitchpatch adventure at [blog.pitchpatch.co][]!

title: What is CoreOS for?

CoreOS is an operating system which attempts to minimise

- overhead of unneeded services
- complexity and variability

while still providing a useful and familiar software environment.

These properties make it useful for:

- Running software in isolated environments (containers/virtual machines), where much functionality can provided directly by the environment host's services and software.
- Automating software deployment, since complex and unknown environments will need equally sophisticated software to handle them.

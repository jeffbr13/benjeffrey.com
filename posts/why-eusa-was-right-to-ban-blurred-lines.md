title: Why EUSA Was Right To Ban "Blurred Lines"

description: As EUSA's campus ban of "Blurred Lines" is snowballing across the world, here's my opinion.

I've been surprised by the amount of backlash against [Robin Thicke's track with the rapey lyrics](http://www.lyrics.com/blurred-lines-lyrics-robin-thicke.html) being banned across more and more UK campuses. Our [student union](http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/) here at the University of Edinburgh was, I believe, the first to ban "Blurred Lines" due to a combination of:

1. EUSA's zero-tolerance [sexual harassment campaign/policy](http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/run/training/zerotolerancecampaign/), and
2. Our Freshers Week being earlier than most (16th September onwards).

Upon returning for Freshers, a fair few of my student chums expressed outrage at EUSA seeming to act out yet again, and this time against one of summer's [most popular singles](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5687036/robin-thickes-blurred-lines-is-billboards-song-of-the-summer).

But first, a bit of background: although I'm not familiar with any other student unions, EUSA is often regarded by UoE students as having a rather heavy hand. Last year, for example, we had [a large brouhaha](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/11/student-newspaper-gagged-edinburgh-university) when [they gagged The Student with an injunction](http://www.studentnewspaper.org/tag/injunction/), supposedly over protecting an employee's privacy, but at first glance because of internal politics. Personally, I'm *still* unsure what occurred, and I don't really care enough to find out what it was all about.

I'm not surprised that many see EUSA's "Blurred Lines" ban as further proof of a willingness to use censorship as a first resort against, well... everything. But, as much distaste as I have for student politics, I don't support this hypothesis.

## What Did EUSA Actually Do?

Did EUSA overexert their powers in this situation? I would say not.

- They banned a single song from playing in venues which they operate,
- In doing so, they increased awareness of misogyny in popular music,
- The track was on it's way out anyway,
- If you still want to hear it you can go *anywhere* else in Edinburgh.

Talk about proportional and well-measured response! At the very least they deserve an internet meme for all that:

At the end of the day, what did EUSA actually do?

They did not 'ban' the track on campus, in any literal sense; EUSA operates (owns?) the venues where the track is no longer allowed to be played. Without stepping on anybody's rights, it is perfectly entitled to choose it's songs or [refuse to sell products][page 3 ban] as it sees fit.

And yes, if EUSA did follow it's zero-tolerance policy to it's logical conclusion then they'd have to stop playing a whole bunch of other songs, too. But banning songs isn't the point! I don't believe that (all) the folks at EUSA want to play moral arbiter and make people suffer by dictating what they can/can't listen to. They could have done that much more effectively by following their principle to the letter,  actually banning a significant portion of modern recordings, and making their venues irrelevant in the process. But they're no Chairman Mao. This wasn't meant to be cultural revolution, it was *targeted assassination*. 

**EUSA have banned a popular (but fading) track so that we have this debate in the first place.** After all, if you still want to hear Blurred Lines in a club, there are plenty of venues in Edinburgh which will happily play radio-music for you every night of the week[^1].

The University of Edinburgh has apparently been subject to ["public humiliation"](http://tychy.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/another-eusa-censorship-disaster/) in the [national](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/24071219) (and now [international](https://news.google.com/news?ned=us&q=blurred%20lines%20eusa%20ban&btnG=Search+News)) press because of EUSA taking this stand, 'over a song', but hey, you're the ones wailing about it. And all this debate still sounds better than hearing *that damn song again*...

[^1]: I personally found the DJ at [Castle Clvb](http://www.theskinny.co.uk/venue/9432-castle_club) last Saturday night to be extremely entertaining. Not only did he have a library consisting entirely of circa 2007 rap music (i.e. 50 Cent and Eminem) but he also had this ability, nay *need*, to change tracks every 90 seconds on the dot! 2.5/5, funniest DJ set ever.

title: Are more security cameras a good idea?

[Slate][] recently published an article by Farhad Manjoo (entitled "[We
Need More Cameras, and We Need Them Now][manjoo]") petitioning for more
security cameras in "cities under the threat of terrorist attack". The
article is disappointingly written in the context of this week's Boston
Marathon bombing, and at first glance seems to validate trading
privacy rights for security.

The article is short, and gives only a cursory nod to arguments levied
against surveillance states; arguments we've perhaps heard more often
here in the UK, living in the '[camera capital of the world][westminster
cameras]' after all.

It's certainly an attractive view, looking at the issue from the other
side. After all, (Manjoo's argument goes...) *security cameras are
better than myriad scanners, security guards, security
restrictions*, etc. etc.

Farhad Manjoo seems to envision a world where security cameras replace
the rest of the 'security' ensemble, and we take their tradeoffs as part
of the deal. Sure, you're watched more, but you're hassled less!

My main issue with this article is that cameras have never been used as a
replacement to more intrusive security methods, bit to complement them.
Not only are you still patted down, but you're also be taped at the same
time! The author of the article wants soft (but constant) vigilance, a
background-hum of security. What we'd almost inevitably get is something
more akin to mosquitoes around British holidaymakers, *id est*, a
background buzz as a constant reminder that you could get stung at any
moment.

In the wake of the terrorist attack in Boston, we've seen online
communities putting in time and effort to catch the criminals
responsible. However, as Reddit's misidentification of a teenager as the
bomber at the Boston Marathon demonstrated, mistakes are made when
there's not enough information available. The kid was shown innocent by
intermediate video-frames. This mistake was caused by
the 'authorities' in this situation only releasing as much information to
the public as they thought necessary. Unfortunately they got "how many
frames of video the public needs to see" wrong. They did fix the
mistaken-identity error by releasing intermediate frames, but that's just
one instance of a larger possible set of errors due to the fact that
they've only released a subset of the information that *they* have
available to them.

To give another example of the public solving a case, see when 4chan
found the evidence in a gang-rape case which had eluded the 'authorities'
for months.

I think (to misuse an aphorism) that in a world where information is
power, huge numbers of security cameras (as the author advocates)
would shift more power to the 'authorities' who control the cameras and
away from the citizens.

You'll notice my use of quote-marks when  mentioning the 'authorities'.
I'm doing that because the 'authorities' are just people too, at the end
of the day. They're probably not malicious (although that's always a
possibility) but they *are* human i.e. *fallible*.

Terrorism *is* a threat to you as a citizen. But you know what's a much
larger *risk*? Hit-and-run drivers. Or getting mugged. Or raped. Our
thoughts on what 'security' means to us ought not be too biased towards
such small risks. Security is how safe we are from crime in general, I
would argue.

Cameras on every street-corner would help in securing us against all
sorts of crime, the kind which occurs everyday{fn: Not only would cameras
on every corner be invaluable in fighting crime, but Google's Street View
would be defunct! There's probably a lot of value in being able to
surveill almost any public place.} ! But that's assuming that someone's
watching the footage. The 'authorities' will make mistakes. Anyone will.
But as we've seen before: with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.

What does soft security look like? ---------

A regime of **soft-security** based on unintrusive surveillance may
actually work. But it requires a lot of trust and cooperation between
citizens/communities and the 'authorities', not just a whole lot of
cameras.

Personal responsibility would need to be engendered in citizens. The role
of the justice system was originally to take punishment for misdeeds out
of citizens' hands, to enable a fair and civilized society. Citizens have
an interest in making the system work for them, rather than being looked
after by a nanny state and a police force which you are entirely subject
to. You, the citizen, must be vigilant for your own safety. The police
force would have to exist with a very specific mandate: to keep public
order and to protect citizens, not to threaten them. The police-officer
is your friend, not an independent arbiter of rough justice.

It relies on parts: the fact that if a crime is committed (or contested)
in a public area then there is likely footage of it. That people will
know this. That this footage is part of the public record, and is easily
available for examination by anyone.

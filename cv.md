### Newsletter Designer & Senior Sound Engineer, Barnard Castle School, 2011-2012

I was tasked with redesigning the school newsletter, a PDF emailed out to
parents at the end of every week. The design was well received, and I
continued to be in charge of the layout every week, for about 15 issues
until the editor retook control of the process.

I have also contributed pictures to school publications and brochures
from time-to-time, and photography is an occasional hobby of mine.

I was brought onto the school's Tech Crew, issued with a polo-shirt and a
few instruction manuals, before being told that we had a matter of weeks
before the opening night of the senior school play. Ha-hah!

I gained experience in setting up and controlling a variety of sound
equipment in medium-sized halls, as well as smaller, more intimate venues
for private events.

### EPQ Software Project, Easter Term 2012

I completed the <a href="http://www.aqa.org.uk/qualifications/projects
/extended-project-epq.php">AQA EPQ qualification</a> a little while ago,
writing my own blogging software in the <a href="http://golang.org">Go
programming language</a>.

### School Leavers Hoodies & Yearbooks, Barnard Castle School, June-July 2012

Whilst gearing up for summer exam revision, a few friends and I took it
upon ourselves to not only organise that year's leavers hoodies, but also
to produce the first yearbook in our school's history.

The first task involved writing a proposal to the headmaster before
getting the word out to students, and then getting all the forms in;
sizes, colour preferences, the correct spellings of nicknames - all had
to be checked and double-checked before the order was sent off.

The yearbook process was similar. But harder! To cut down on costs we did
the design in-house. Which actually meant that *I* did the
design! Add to that the much greater amount of information to collect and
collate, along with getting enough orders to make the entire project
viable - remembering that this was a first in the school's history, the
yeargroup were naturally apprehensive.

Not only that, but the material which was submitted by students forms had
to be fit to print, in the opinion of the school administration - and it
was a balancing act to ensure that the spirit of a class of eighteen-
year-olds was accurately reflected on pages that would be archived and be
displayed with the school badge on them. This was a job in salesmanship
as much as it was in graphic design!

Both these efforts were met with a great response, with the majority of
leavers buying a hoodie, and three-fifths of the Upper-Sixth Form leaving
with a yearbook, which was delivered in time to be handed out to everyone
on results day!

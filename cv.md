Employment

### Data Acquisition Intern, [Skyscanner](http://skyscanner.net) (Summer 2013)

I worked with a team of other interns, maintaining and growing Skyscanner's
large collection of international airline scrapers, written in Python.
Duties included maintaining and updating database records, as well as
interfacing with airline counterparts in resolving issues with APIs or
webscrapers.

Variety of teas provided, excellent coffee from the company barista machine!

Collecting survey data over the telephone, from participant feedback on
government programs to the monthly political thermometer. Brought my own
cuppas in a thermos.

### Waiter, [Fratello's Restaurant Scotch Corner](http://www.fratellosscotchcorner.co.uk/) (Summer 2012)

Bussing tables, manning the bar, serving banquets. Not much time for tea.

### Junior Javascript Developer, [Accendo Design](http://www.accendodesign.com/) (July-August 2011)

Three weeks of work experience, given the Rhino book to learn Javascript
on the job, and wrote some webform validation code for a real-estate management
startup. First tastes of many strange and exotic teas.

### Office Assistant, [Anarkik3D](http://www.anarkik3d.co.uk/) (June 2011)

One week of work experience, which included
playing with the company's 3D drafting software, writing

neatening up webpages, brewing the tea, and other essential
office-work.

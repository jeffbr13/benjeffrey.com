Hey there. I'm Ben.

I'm currently studying for my Master of Informatics degree at
[the University of Edinburgh][uni].

I'm a hands-on learner and a methodical worker. I rather enjoy operating
in high-pressure situations and tight turnaround times, with skilled and
friendly people.

Previous Employment
-------------------

### Office Assistant, [Anarkik3D Limited](http://www.anarkik3d.co.uk/) (June 2011)

One week of work experience, which included
playing with the company's 3D drafting software, writing
a small Python application to interface with social networks,
neatening up webpages, brewing the tea, and other essential
office-work.

### Junior Javascript Developer, [Accendo Design](http://www.accendodesign.com/) (July-August 2011)

Three weeks of work experience, given the Rhino book to learn Javascript
on the job, and building webform validation for a real-estate management
startup. I also learned the ins-and-outs of all sorts of strange and
exotic teas!

### Waiter, [Fratello's Restaurant Scotch Corner](http://www.fratellosscotchcorner.co.uk/) (Summer 2012)

I spent the majority of my time as a waiter bussing tables, along with
a couple of nights on the hotel banqueting team for important occasions,
as well as a few late nights helping out at the Columbus Bar.

### Telephone Interviewer, [Ipsos Mori Scotland](http://www.ipsos-mori.com/offices/scotland.aspx) (Winter 2012-2013)


University of Edinburgh (2012-2017)

Currently studying to be a [Master of Informatics (MInf)][minf]
at [the University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk).

### Hackathons

* Day-of-Code Retreat
* University of Edinburgh ILWHack ([my team][INF-YT] won the "Best Data Mashup"
    category, along with some Nexus 7s!)

* A in Latin (A2 level)

### Newsletter Designer & Senior Sound Engineer, Barnard Castle School (2011-2012)

I did layout for 15 issues of the school's weekly newsletter, using a custom
design and the [Scribus NG](http://scribus.net/canvas/Scribus)
desktop-publishing software.

I also contributed pictures to school publications and brochures
from time-to-time, and photography is still an [occasional hobby of mine][flickr].

I was on the school's Tech Crew, issued with a polo-shirt and a few
instruction manuals, and given control of the sound-board for all major
productions during my last year in the Sixth Form. I also set up sound
for a friend's band a couple of times, and got paid in pints, which was
pretty fun, too!


### EPQ Software Project

I completed the <a href="http://www.aqa.org.uk/qualifications/projects
/extended-project-epq.php">AQA EPQ qualification</a> a little while ago,
writing my own blogging software in the <a href="http://golang.org">Go
programming language</a>.


### School Leavers Hoodies & Yearbooks, Barnard Castle School (June-July 2012)

A few friends and I organised our year's leavers hoodies, and produced
the first yearbook in our school's history.

Both these efforts involved writing proposals to the headmaster, selling
to students, getting all the forms in and checking them; sizes, colour
preferences, nicknames - all checked and double-checked before the orders
were sent off. To cut down costs on the yearbook, we also did the design
in-house. Which actually meant that *I* did the design! And while the
yearbooks were sold to the pupils, I had to sell the idea to the
teachers!

These efforts were rewarded with a great response, the majority of
leavers bought hoodies, and three-fifths of the Upper-Sixth Form left
with a yearbook, handed to them on results day.
